# DSA

This repository contains solutions and implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, following the Striver's DSA roadmap. It is organized into different sections to help you build a strong foundation in DSA.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. Basics
This folder contains foundational concepts of DSA, divided into subfolders:

#### 1.1 Build Up Logical Thinking
Contains programs to develop logical thinking through pattern-based problems. Examples include:
- **Patterns**: Programs to print various patterns like triangles, diamonds, and more.

#### 1.2 Basic Math
Includes programs to solve basic mathematical problems:
- **ArmstrongNumber.cpp**: Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
- **CountNumber.cpp**: Count the number of digits in a number.
- **GCD.cpp**: Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- **PallinDrome.cpp**: Check if a number is a palindrome.
- **Prime.cpp**: Check if a number is prime.
- **PrintAllDivisors.cpp**: Print all divisors of a number.
- **ReverseNumber.cpp**: Reverse a given number.

#### 1.3 Basic Recursion
Programs to understand recursion through practical examples:
- **Factorial.cpp**: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
- **Fibonacci.cpp**: Generate Fibonacci numbers using recursion.
- **Linear_NTimes.cpp**: Linear recursion examples.
- **N_Times.cpp**: Print a message N times using recursion.
- **PallinDrome.cpp**: Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- **Reverse_Linear.cpp**: Reverse a sequence using linear recursion.
- **ReverseArray.cpp**: Reverse an array using recursion.
- **Sum.cpp**: Calculate the sum of numbers using recursion.

#### 1.4 Hashing
Basic implementation of hashing concepts:
- **basic.cpp**: Demonstrates hashing techniques.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and compile the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler like `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file_name
   ```

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and DSA concepts
